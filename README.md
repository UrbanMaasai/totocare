Android eCommerce app focused on baby care products
### Product focus: 
Baby Clothing, Shoes, Nutrition (Food, Milk), Baby care products (toiletry, pampers, jelly, powder), Toys etc.
The database to adopt: we propose a combination of SQLite and google cloud Firestore.
### User Journey: 
we have identified 3 users, the buyer, seller and admin. Admin a/c will be back-end only; dashboard control.
Ability for Users to create a profile on the app. The buyer however should still view products and add to cart without setting up an account; we can then prompt creation of account at the point of checking out. Seller able to login, uploading and publishing products
### Payment modes: 
Support for Cash on delivery, Mobile payment and Paypal. Consider Location based payment method recommendation. i.e. Moses for Kenya, Tigo Pesa TZ, MTN MoMo Nigeria etc.
### Stock management: 
allow items on cart up to 24-hours (Point of discussion) before automatically releasing same to other buyers
Return a product: Buyer to mark it up on the app as returned, call seller to arrange return and once confirmed as returned by seller, s(he) to avail it on app. the admin should be able to track returned products and respective reason for return
Product Rating: 
Only customers who have already bought a product, should be allowed to rate products
### Recommendation engine: 
Customer recommendation based on discounts, views, likes,
Product distribution/Delivery: Some proposed we handle delivery ourselves while others were of the opinion we should partner with existing companies like Glovo/Sendy and only provide a way to track delivery status of product on the app (Please give your opinion)
### Conclusion:
We finally agreed to list down all activities down and how each is related to the other. Then try visualize how each one expects the app design to be (UI) on paper. When we meet next we are to vote on the best and which will be adopted.
A google sheet will be shared for the purpose of tracking the activities identified.
We are also to agree on how to split the development amongst us.
